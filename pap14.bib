  abstract={The onset conditions for the m / n = 2/1 neoclassical tearing mode are studied in terms of neoclassical drive, triggering instabilities, and toroidal rotation or rotation shear, in the spherical torus NSTX (Ono M. et al 2000 Nucl. Fusion [/0029-5515/40/3y/316] 40 557 ). There are three typical onset conditions for these modes, given in order of increasing neoclassical drive required for mode onset: triggering by energetic particle modes, triggering by edge localized modes and cases where the modes appear to grow without a trigger. In all cases, the required drive increases with toroidal rotation shear, implying a stabilizing effect from the shear.}

  abstract={The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is being built at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory to test the fusion physics principles for the spherical torus concept at the MA level. The NSTX nominal plasma parameters are R 0 = 85 cm, a = 67 cm, R/a ≥ 1.26, B t = 3 kG, I p = 1 MA, q 95 = 14, elongation κ ≤ 2.2, triangularity δ ≤ 0.5 and a plasma pulse length of up to 5 s. The plasma heating/current drive tools are high harmonic fast wave (6 MW, 5 s), neutral beam injection (5 MW, 80 keV, 5 s) and coaxial helicity injection. Theoretical calculations predict that NSTX should provide exciting possibilities for exploring a number of important new physics regimes, including very high plasma β, naturally high plasma elongation, high bootstrap current fraction, absolute magnetic well and high pressure driven sheared flow. In addition, the NSTX programme plans to explore fully non-inductive plasma startup as well as a dispersive scrape-off layer for heat and particle flux handling.}

  abstract={Resistive wall mode (RWM) instabilities are found to be a limiting factor in advanced tokamak regimes with low internal inductance. Even small amplitude modes can affect the rotation profile and the performance of these ELMing H mode discharges. Although complete stabilization of the RWM by plasma rotation has not yet been observed, several discharges with increased beam momentum and power injection sustained good steady state performance for record durations. The first investigation of active feedback control of the RWM has shown promising results: the leakage of radial magnetic flux through the resistive wall can be successfully controlled and the duration of the high beta phase can be prolonged. The results provide a comparative test of several approaches to active feedback control, and are being used to benchmark the analysis and computational models of active control.}

  abstract={Two important effects of MHD fluctuations in the RFP and tokamak are current generation (the dynamo effect) and mode locking. In the T1 and MST RFP experiments new results reveal the mode dynamics underlying these phenomena. In T1 the effect of specific magnetic Fourier modes on the current density profile is evident. In MST, the MHD dynamo term ( delta v* delta B) is measured in the plasma edge, and found to account for the time dependence of the edge current throughout a sawtooth cycle. As edge resistivity is increased in T1 the fluctuation amplitude increases to maintain the dynamo-driven current, as expected from MHD computation. The modes responsible for the dynamo often lock to the local magnetic field error at the vertical cut in MST. The plasma rotation velocity has been measured with a fast Doppler spectrometer to a time resolution of 1 mu s. The plasma rotation and mode phase velocity are remarkably well-correlated, with both slowing, in the presence of an impulsive field error, in a 100 mu s timescale.}

  abstract={Dedicated experiments on TF ripple effects on the performance of tokamak plasmas have been carried out at JET. The TF ripple was found to have a profound effect on the plasma rotation. The central Mach number, M , defined as the ratio of the rotation velocity and the thermal velocity, was found to drop as a function of TF ripple amplitude (δ) from an average value of M = 0.40–0.55 for operations at the standard JET ripple of δ = 0.08% to M = 0.25–0.40 for δ = 0.5% and M = 0.1–0.3 for δ = 1%. TF ripple effects should be considered when estimating the plasma rotation in ITER. With standard co-current injection of neutral beam injection (NBI), plasmas were found to rotate in the co-current direction. However, for higher TF ripple amplitudes (δ ~ 1%) an area of counter rotation developed at the edge of the plasma, while the core kept its co-rotation. The edge counter rotation was found to depend, besides on the TF ripple amplitude, on the edge temperature. The observed reduction of toroidal plasma rotation with increasing TF ripple could partly be explained by TF ripple induced losses of energetic ions, injected by NBI. However, the calculated torque due to these losses was insufficient to explain the observed counter rotation and its scaling with edge parameters. It is suggested that additional TF ripple induced losses of thermal ions contribute to this effect.}

This situation is manifested in computational difficulties which arise in attempts to apply textbook algorithms for computing a minimal realization. Structural instability associated with geometric theories is not unique to control; it arises in the theory of linear equations as well. In this setting, the computational problems have been studied for decades and excellent tools have been developed for coping with the situation. One of the main goals of this paper is to call attention to principal component analysis (Hotelling, 1933), and an algorithm (Golub and Reinsch, 1970) for computing the singular value decompositon of a matrix. Together they form a powerful tool for coping with structural instability in dynamic systems. As developed in this paper, principal component analysis is a technique for analyzing signals. (Singular value decomposition provides the computational machinery.) For this reason, Kalman's minimal realization theory is recast in terms of responses to injected signals. Application of the signal analysis to controllability and observability leads to a coordinate system in which the "internally balanced" model has special properties. For asymptotically stable systems, this yields working approximations ofX_{c}, X_{bar{o}}, the controllable and unobservable subspaces. It is proposed that a natural first step in model reduction is to apply the mechanics of minimal realization using these working subspaces.},

  abstract={In this work we develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for the feedback stabilization of a thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited burn conditions. A volume-averaged zero-dimensional nonlinear model is used to represent the time evolution of the electron density, the relative density of alpha particles and the temperature of the plasma, where a particular scaling law for the energy confinement time previously used by other authors, was adopted. The control actions include the concurrent modulation of the D-T refuelling rate, the injection of a neutral He-4 beam and an auxiliary heating power modulation, which are constrained to take values within a maximum and minimum levels. For this purpose a feedforward multilayer artificial neural network with sigmoidal activation function is trained using a back-propagation through-time technique. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the behaviour of the resulting ANN-dynamical system configuration. It is concluded that the resulting ANN can successfully stabilize the nonlinear model of the thermonuclear reactor at nearly ignited conditions for temperature and density departures significantly far from their nominal operating values. The NN-dynamical system configuration is shown to be robust with respect to the thermalization time of the alpha particles for perturbations within the region used to train the NN.}

  abstract={In order for ITER to be capable of operating in advanced tokamak operating regimes, characterized by a high fusion gain, good plasma confinement, magnetohydrodynamic stability and a non-inductively driven plasma current, for extended periods of time, several challenging plasma control problems still need to be solved. Setting up a suitable toroidal current density profile in the tokamak is key for one possible advanced operating scenario characterized by non-inductive sustainment of the plasma current. At the DIII-D tokamak, the goal is to create the desired current profile during the ramp-up and early flat-top phases of the plasma discharge and then actively maintain this target profile for the remainder of the discharge. The evolution in time of the toroidal current profile in tokamaks is related to the evolution of the poloidal magnetic flux profile, which is modelled in normalized cylindrical coordinates using a first-principles, nonlinear, dynamic partial differential equation (PDE) referred to as the magnetic diffusion equation. The magnetic diffusion equation is combined with empirical correlations developed from physical observations and experimental data from DIII-D for the electron temperature, the plasma resistivity and the non-inductive current drive to develop a simplified, control-oriented, nonlinear, dynamic PDE model of the poloidal flux profile evolution valid for low confinement mode discharges. In this work, we synthesize a robust feedback controller to reject disturbances and track a desired reference trajectory of the poloidal magnetic flux gradient profile by employing the control-oriented model of the system. A singular value decomposition of the static gain matrix of the plant model is utilized to identify the most relevant control channels and is combined with the dynamic response of system around a given operating trajectory to design the feedback controller. A general framework for real-time feedforward + feedback control of magnetic and kinetic plasma profiles was implemented in the DIII-D Plasma Control System and was used to demonstrate the ability of the feedback controller to control the toroidal current profile evolution in the DIII-D tokamak. These experiments constitute the first time ever a first-principles-driven, model-based, closed-loop magnetic profile controller was successfully implemented and tested in a tokamak device.}

  abstract={A comprehensive transport equation for the evolution of toroidal rotation in tokamak plasmas is developed self-consistently from the two-fluid momentum equations taking account of the constraints imposed by faster time scale processes. The resultant plasma toroidal rotation equation includes the effects of collision-induced perpendicular viscosities, anomalous transport due to microturbulence in the plasma, momentum sources and collision-based parallel viscous forces due to 3D non-axisymmetric (NA) magnetic field components produced by external fields and MHD-type instabilities in the plasma. Non-resonant NA fields produce a toroidal torque throughout the plasma that relaxes the toroidal flow to an 'intrinsic' or 'offset' ion-temperature-gradient diamagnetic-type flow in the direction counter to the plasma current. A NA resonant field error causes a toroidal torque localized near its rational surface. The combination of resonant and non-resonant NA field components is found to predict scalings for error field penetration and mode locking thresholds that are in closer agreement with empirical data from tokamak plasmas.}
